# Hello! Welcome to the tutorial!
<a href="http://www.webmonkey.com/2010/02/php_tutorial_for_beginners/">Take a look at this tutorial, it is an overview of what PHP is and what it can do</a></p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Now let's make some things! Create a file. For the steps below, just keep adding on to the file with each step, don't erase step 1 when you do step 2.</p>
		</li>
		<li>
			<p>Part 1 - Getting Started!</p>
		</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Print Julia with PHP </li>
			<li>
				<p>Now let's add some formatting, add a h1 around Julia but keep it separate from the PHP.</p>
				<p>Since PHP prints are treated as HTML it's easy to end up in the habit of putting HTML formatting inside the PHP print statement. Don't get into this habit though! We want to keep the HTML as separate from the PHP as we can. This allows for easier change in the future if we need to change the HTML, we don't have to go through a bunch of PHP to find it, it will just always be pure HTML on the page.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Make a simple form like in the tutorial. Have two inputs, one for First Name and one for Last Name. When the form submits have it print the name above the form.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Let's add an if statement to the form results. If the value in first name is Julia, have what prints when the form submits say "It's Julia! :D" along with the entered name. If the value isn't Julia, have it print "It's not Julia :( " along with the entered name.</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>Array Time! Create an array and fill it with your favorite things. Look up using print_r vs print, print your array!</p>
			</li>
		</ol>
